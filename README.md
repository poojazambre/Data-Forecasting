## Data Forecasting in Excel
I used Excel to forecast the data and predict the values for future dates. In this project, the count of views for a YouTube channel has been taken as historical data, and based on it, the count of future dates has been predicted using Excel. Upon comparing with the original views count, I found that this model predicts values close to the correct ones.

## Project Overview
The primary goal of this project was to predict future view counts for a YouTube channel using historical data. By leveraging Excel's powerful forecasting tools, I was able to generate accurate predictions, which are crucial for strategic planning and decision-making. This project highlights my expertise in data forecasting and my ability to deliver actionable insights through data analysis.

Three mehtods are used for the forecasting :
1. Using formula in Excel = Forecast
2. Using trending graph
3. Using Forecasting Sheet option
